# K-Means Clustering Customer Segmentation

## In this case study, you will implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). You'll use real data containing information on marketing newsletters and email campaigns, as transaction-level data from customers.

## Structure of the mini-project:

## 1. Sourcing and loading

- Load the data

- Explore the data

## 2. Cleaning, transforming and visualizing

Data Wrangling: Exercise Set 1

- Creating a matrix with a binary indicator for whether they responded to a given offer
- Ensure that in doing so, NAN values are dealt with appropriately

## 3. Modelling

K-Means clustering: Exercise Sets 2 and 3

- Choosing K: The Elbow method
- Choosing K: The Silhouette method
- Choosing K: The Gap statistic method
- Visualizing clusters with PCA: Exercise Sets 4 and 5

## 4. Conclusions and next steps

- Conclusions
- Other clustering algorithms (Exercise Set 6)
